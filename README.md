**Let me tell you a bit about myself.**

I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection where logic meets creativity.  I work as a **Frontend Developer**and UI/UX Developer, but I like to think of myself as a builder of experiences.

For me, code isn't just about syntax or algorithms; it's a modern form of storytelling. I spend my days (and often my nights) blending the precision of **AI** with the fluidity of **interface design**. My goal is simple: to make the web feel faster, smarter, and a little more human.

<br>

**The tools I use to create.**

When I sit down to build, these are the technologies I reach for. They aren't just tools to me; they are the medium through which I solve problems.

**What's on my mind right now?**

It's 2026, and the landscape is shifting. Currently, I'm focused on removing the clutter. I'm exploring how **Minimalism** and **Generative AI** can work together to create interfaces that don't just look good, but actually anticipate what the user needs.

I believe in the idea that *complexity is easy, but simplicity is hard.*

**A thought for the day.**
